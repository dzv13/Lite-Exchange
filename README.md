I recommend using GUI Scale: Normal in the Video Settings.
You can set up the rest of the settings however you like but there are some things to note about the controls
```

```
The following controls are kind important so pay close attention to what you set them to:
Open Quests          - Once you enter the world, this should be the first button you click.
Excavate             - Breaks multiple blocks at a time. (Hold key while breaking blocks)
JEI.Show Recipe      - Super important in order to figure out how to craft things (Hover Over Item while clicking key)
JEI.Show Usage       - Super important in order to figure out how blocks work (Hover Over Item while clicking key)
ProjectE.Charge      - Increases the range of ProjectE Items (Crouch+Key to uncharge)
ProjectE.Change Mode - Cycles through the modes of ProjectE Items
```

```
I have the following Controls unbinded:
Creative Mode    - You're not in creative mode.
Advancements     - There are quests instead.
Corporea Request - It's a late game Botania thing.
Quark            - There are GUI options for all of these.
RFTools          - Not Needed. If I could I would remove em.
Liquid View      - There's only 3 Main Liquids.
```

```
These are Keybinds you can choose whether or not you want:
Baubles Inventory          - Basically opens up your bauble slots. There's a button in your inventory as well.
Zoom                       - This is a Optifine key for zooming in.
Chisel n Bits              - The Radial Menu is the useful one. The rest are redundant. Undo and Redo are pretty useful as well though.
Extra Utilities.Search     - While hovering over an item, click this key and it will highlight chests that have that item.
Mekanism.Mode Switch       - For Cycling through modes. Item Mode is important for the Configurator. The other two are meh armor stuff.
Mekanism.Voice             - Helpful for getting extra info while hovering over items.
OreExcavation.Shape Toggle - not necessary but it can be helpful as well. It changes which blocks OreExcavation breaks.
Reliquary.Fortune Coin     - Kinda useful to set this. But you can just Crouch+Use while holding the coin so it's optional.
The Rest of JEI            - Besides Recipe and Usage. The rest of those keybinds are up to you.
ProjectE.Armor             - Hotkey to activate and deactivate Armor Effects.
ProjectE.Extra             - Philosopher's Stone has a crafting table inside when you click this button while holding it.
ProjectE.Projectile        - Shoots a thing. Diff Items have diff projectile effects.
```
